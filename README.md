# DB importing to AWS RDS
This project consists of importing a pandas database to an AWS RDS database using python. The database to be imported comes from the project [API with Python](https://github.com/Villarreal93/API-with-Python). The data from the official NFL's Youtube channel is collected in two pulls, three days apart, and uploaded to AWS as one table. The engine used for the database is PostgreSQL and VS code is used to connect to the AWS DB to confirm the successful importing of the data.

# Reference
I saw this idea on Nate's Youtube channel, and I'm only using it to learn. If interested, go watch his full video (& channel!) on how to do this project:
